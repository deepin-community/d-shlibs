Description: Debian shared library package building helper scripts
 Shared library packages in Debian need some special catering
 to do with regards to which files go where.
 This package contains programs
 which try to help automate the process
 and catch simple errors.
 .
  * "d-shlibmove" moves the shared library binary around
    from temporary installation directory
    to the  destination package directory.
  * "d-devlibdeps" tries to list the development library dependencies
    required for using the -dev package.
